# Advanced-driver-assistance-system
This system is designed to enhance road safety by detecting driver drowsiness through monitoring their eye movements. By analyzing the duration of eye closure, the system can determine if the driver is becoming drowsy and alert them accordingly with an alarm. The primary goal of this project is to minimize the occurrence of road accidents.
# Purpose
The main objective of this project is to enhance road safety by addressing the issue of driver drowsiness. Leveraging computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms, the system accurately monitors eye movements to identify signs of drowsiness. By promptly alerting drivers, the system can help prevent accidents and save lives.
# Data set 
For training and testing the drowsiness detection model, I utilized the MRL dataset, which can be accessed [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jbyNv5Q_RDKx7ijkgbmQfUZF-8KddVCP?usp=sharing). This dataset provides a comprehensive collection of eye images that are crucial for developing an accurate and reliable model.
# Trained Model
I have trained a drowsiness detection model using the aforementioned dataset, achieving commendable performance in detecting driver drowsiness. You can download the trained model from this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-ySUSwiAIyP4YrdvbBT5I-eyWlLNrYmm?usp=sharing)
