# advanced-driver-assistance-system
This system is designed to enhance road safety by detecting driver drowsiness through monitoring their eye movements. By analyzing the duration of eye closure, the system can determine if the driver is becoming drowsy and alert them accordingly with an alarm. The primary goal of this project is to minimize the occurrence of road accidents.
